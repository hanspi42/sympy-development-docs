# SymPy Development Docs
This is a repository for documents shared by developers of SymPy, for example errata for textbooks, notes by developers, etc.

Developers must make sure that material uploaded here is publishable. Short textbook excerpts for the sake of documenting errata are always OK, but longer excerpts can only be uploaded if the book is already in the public domain, or if the copyright holder has given consent.

The structure of the directory tree should be the same as the one in https://github.com/sympy/sympy/tree/master/sympy itself.
